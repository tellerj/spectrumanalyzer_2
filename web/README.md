# Still to do: 
- ensure that the ffmpeg library gets installed on destination machine
- add inject buttons to simulate different scenarios
- add functionality to add or remove spikes on the /settings page
- make update_running_config count signal spikes properly
- extend boundaries of the line that is computed out about 10 points at both ends to make it animate off-screen
- tune number of frames to ensure the animation always starts and ends off-screen
- put the app.py functions in an app.py class? Make an app.py config? 
- make the regen of the animation clean up old animations
- resize the animation to take up more of the screen
- center animation on index page
- adjust colors of: 
-- line
-- spectrum background
-- index page background
-- settings page background
- package everything up for export offline
- update this to be an actual readme


# Done
- Make form default values match the current running config
- make form submission update the .gif of the spectrum
